# OpenFlights for MariaDB
This is a repo to demonstrate MariaDB features with the publicly available data set from [openflights](https://github.com/jpatokal/openflights).

## Request for MariaDB use case references
We are **requesting contributions** to demonstrate MariaDB features with OpenFlights data. 

* A great list of features to pick from is available in founder Monty Widenius' blog [Celebrating 15 years of MariaDB](https://monty-says.blogspot.com/2024/10/celebrating-15-years-of-mariadb.html). Pick a feature within any category: storage engines, performance, optimizer, security, replication, logging, DDL enhancements, or other features.
* Explore MariaDB training material at [uni.mariadb.org](https://uni.mariadb.org) and suggest training exercises for specific lessons. 

## Using OpenFlights data in MariaDB

### Option 1: Loading data into MariaDB in a Docker container

A simple way to get started, is to load the OpenFlights data into a MariaDB Docker container. 

1. Copy the OpenFlights for MariaDB repo from the Github.

	```sh
	git clone https://github.com/mariadb/openflights
	cd openflights
	```

2. Run a MariaDB database Docker container and copy the repo files into it.

	```sh
	docker run -d \
  	--name openflights-mariadb \
  	-e MARIADB_ROOT_PASSWORD=rootpw123 \
  	-p 3306:3306 \
  	-v $(pwd):/openflights \
  	mariadb:11.4
	```

3. Create database and tables in MariaDB (as root user).

	```sh
	docker exec -i openflights-mariadb bash -c "mariadb -u root -prootpw123 < /openflights/sql/create.sql"
	```

4. Load the data into MariaDB (as root user).
 
	```sh
	docker exec -i openflights-mariadb bash -c "cd /openflights && mariadb -u root -prootpw123 flightdb2 < sql/load-data.sql"
	```

5. Open MariaDB client within docker container.

	```sh
	docker exec -it openflights-mariadb mariadb -u root -prootpw123
	```

6. Select the openflight database and show what tables it contains.

	```sql
	SHOW databases;
	USE flightdb2
	SHOW tables;
	```

7. Check what columns table airports has, and fetch five rows for all columns (*) and defined columns (name, city, country).

	```sql
	DESC airports;
	SELECT * FROM airports LIMIT 5;
	SELECT name, city, country FROM airports LIMIT 5;
	```

### Option 2: Run the complete OpenFlights application in a Docker container

Another option is to run the OpenFlights application by using its ```docker-compose.yml```, but this has not yet been adjusted for MariaDB in this repo.

# OpenFlights

Welcome to the code base for [OpenFlights](https://openflights.org), a tool that lets you map your flights around the world, search and filter them in all sorts of interesting ways, calculate statistics automatically, and share your flights and trips with friends and the entire world (if you wish).

## Data

Most people come here for the **free airport, airline and route data**. See the [documentation](https://openflights.org/data.php) or plunge straight into the [data itself](data/).

## User interface

See [`locale`](locale/) for supported languages and instructions for editing them or adding new ones.

## Code

I'll be upfront: this codebase is an unholy mess. The bulk of it was written in 2008, back when PHP seemed like a good idea and the only way to learn JavaScript was the hard way. Any vestiges of sanity you may encounter (eg. unit and integration tests or package management) were grafted on as an incomplete afterthought.

Basically, though, it's your classic [LNMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_%28software_bundle%29) app. JavaScript frontend (mostly in the monolithic [`openflights.js`](openflights.js), some bits under [`js`](js/)) talking to a Nginx/PHP backend (in [`php`](php/)) that wraps around a MySQL database.

## Tests

Test coverage is woefully incomplete, but comes in three flavors:

- [`client`](test/client/): Client-side full-stack integration tests, require live DB & server
- [`server`](test/server/): Server-side (PHP) integration tests, require a live database
- [`unit`](test/unit/): Client-side JavaScript unit tests

## Installation

See [INSTALL](INSTALL) for system requirements and instructions.

# Development Docker

A basic Docker setup is available to simplify setting up a development environment but requires a
couple of manual steps to get the site up and running.

1. `cp php/config.sample.php php/config.php` and set `$host = "db";` so the host name matches the
   the database container host name.
2. Run `docker-compose up` to create the containers.
3. Install local PHP dependencies inside the container.

   ```
   # host shell
   user@host:openflights $ docker exec -it openflights-web-1 bash

   # container shell
   root@ee261e8f9103:/# cd /var/www/openflights/ && php /usr/local/bin/composer install
   ```

4. You should be able to access the site at `http://localhost:8007`.
